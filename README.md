# ACE-Step-1.5-Docker

Docker container for running ACE-Step 1.5 Gradio UI - A highly efficient open-source music foundation model that brings commercial-grade music generation to consumer hardware.

## About ACE-Step 1.5

ACE-Step v1.5 is a cutting-edge music foundation model that achieves commercial-grade quality while remaining extremely fast and accessible:

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Ultra-Fast Generation**: Under 2 seconds per full song on A100, under 10 seconds on RTX 3090
- **Commercial-Grade Quality**: Performance beyond most commercial music models (between Suno v4.5 and Suno v5)
- **Lightweight**: Runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM
- **Flexible Duration**: Generate music from 10 seconds to 10 minutes (600s)
- **Multi-Language Support**: Lyrics support for 50+ languages
- **Rich Style Support**: 1000+ instruments and styles with fine-grained timbre description
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Cover generation, audio editing, track separation, vocal-to-BGM conversion, LoRA training, and more

### 🎵 What Makes It Special

At its core lies a novel hybrid architecture where the Language Model (LM) functions as an omni-capable planner that transforms simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints. The model synthesizes metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought to guide the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), achieving alignment through intrinsic reinforcement learning.
